# Hepatitis Dataset
This dataset appears to contain information related to liver health. Here's a brief summary:

The dataset includes information on various factors such as age, gender, treatment types (like steroid and antivirals usage), as well as symptoms and clinical measurements. 
It also contains indicators of liver condition, including tests for bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and more. The 'Class' column likely signifies a diagnostic outcome. 
Keep in mind that specific meanings may vary based on the context and source of the dataset.

1. **AGE**: This column likely represents the age of the patients in the dataset. It is a continuous variable.

2. **SEX**: This column likely represents the gender of the patients. It is likely a categorical variable with values like 'Male' and 'Female'.

3. **STEROID**: This column might indicate whether the patient used steroids as part of their treatment. It is likely a binary categorical variable with values like 'Yes' or 'No'.

4. **ANTIVIRALS**: This column might indicate whether the patient received antiviral treatment. It is likely a binary categorical variable.

5. **FATIGUE**: This column may indicate whether the patient experienced fatigue as a symptom. It is likely a binary categorical variable.

6. **MALAISE**: This column may indicate whether the patient experienced general discomfort or unease as a symptom. It is likely a binary categorical variable.

7. **ANOREXIA**: This column may indicate whether the patient experienced loss of appetite as a symptom. It is likely a binary categorical variable.

8. **LIVER_BIG**: This column may indicate whether the patient's liver is enlarged. It is likely a binary categorical variable.

9. **LIVER_FIRM**: This column may indicate the firmness or texture of the patient's liver. It is likely a categorical variable with values like 'Firm' and 'Not Firm'.

10. **SPLEEN_PALPABLE**: This column may indicate whether the spleen is palpable (able to be felt by touch). It is likely a binary categorical variable.

11. **SPIDERS**: This column may indicate whether the patient had spider nevi (small, dilated blood vessels near the surface of the skin). It is likely a binary categorical variable.

12. **ASCITES**: This column may indicate whether the patient had ascites (accumulation of fluid in the abdomen). It is likely a binary categorical variable.

13. **VARICES**: This column may indicate whether the patient had varices (enlarged veins, often in the esophagus or stomach). It is likely a binary categorical variable.

14. **BILIRUBIN**: This column may represent a measure of bilirubin levels in the patient's blood. Bilirubin is a yellow compound that can build up in the body if the liver is not functioning properly. It is likely a continuous variable.

15. **ALK_PHOSPHATE**: This column may represent the level of alkaline phosphatase in the patient's blood. Alkaline phosphatase is an enzyme found in the liver and bones. It is likely a continuous variable.

16. **SGOT**: This column may represent the level of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) in the patient's blood. SGOT is an enzyme found in the liver and heart. It is likely a continuous variable.

17. **ALBUMIN**: This column may represent the level of albumin in the patient's blood. Albumin is a protein produced by the liver. It is likely a continuous variable.

18. **PROTIME**: This column may represent the prothrombin time, which is a measure of blood clotting ability. It is likely a continuous variable.

19. **HISTOLOGY**: This column may indicate whether the patient's liver biopsy showed signs of histological activity. It is likely a binary categorical variable.

20. **Class**: This column likely represents the class or outcome of interest. It could indicate whether the patient was diagnosed with a specific condition or not. It is likely a categorical variable.

Please note that the actual meanings of these columns may vary depending on the context and source of the dataset. Always refer to the dataset's documentation or metadata for the most accurate information.
